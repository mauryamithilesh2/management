    A unit of work assigned to an employee.

    This is the data model only - task views, forms, templates, URLs,
    dashboards, and assignment UI are implemented in a later phase.

    Both user relationships point at the project's existing custom User
    model (settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL) rather than storing names as text,
    so a task always references a real account and stays consistent with
    that account's role/permissions.
